# Project sources for "Sonic Suggests"

![Screenshot](Readme/OldScreenshot.jpg)

Complete source code with resources for Rage 2018 submission - "Sonic Suggests"

I didn't used version control at the time, but i still have original "backup" archives. I reconstructed rough git history from them, so you also can view development progress. There was also quick android port, based on 1.0, i included it aswell in "release/android" branch

Also, in "AssetsSource" original high poly models in SculptGL and .PLY format, you can open them with https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/

Used Unity versions:
- 1.0 - 2017.3.0f3 / 2017.3.0p2
- Android - 2018.1.0f2
- 1.1 - 2018.4.36f1

For 1.0 version i constantly switched between 2 PC (home and work) and they had slightly different unity versions.
1.1 version stored without backup for too long, and seems like i opened it with newer unity version at some point, but i believe it was built with same version as 1.0
